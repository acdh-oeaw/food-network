## Food portal outline

### Resources:

+ exploreAT! thesaurus (food concepts DBÖ) and related data from DBÖ
+ data from DBÖ regarding living organisms
+ data from biodiversity portal /better: access point nhm-webservice
+ TEI Gastrosophie recipes
+ Food ontologies
+ results of ThePort2018/2019 feedforward system
+ brainfood proposal
+ List of external food resources
+ Some ideas for initial brainstorming:

We think about evolving around the intersection of topics of humanitarian challenges, digital tools and “food”: information resources on foods, dishes/recipes, ingredients, cultural aspects, food chains, food production, food consumption, food & health, regional diets, similarities among cultures in regard to food, etc. We devise an open ended proposition, with many possible outcomes, such as:  

+ Food graphs and clusters: use of the many features regarding food (spatial, temporal, ingredients, healthy effects, published studies, combination/harmonization, etc.) to generate clusters and graphs that help us visualize food characteristics (e.g. this neural network visualization) in relation to the hackathon challenge. Some ideas on graphs are:  
    + Food vs food diseases  
    + Countries/Recipes similarities and dissimilarities: Different types of food use: same name of recipes in different region/country, differents ingredients  
    + Ingredients and flavors clusters  
    + Documentation of citizens' food environments   
    + Food waste behavior   
    + Evaluation, sharing and exchanging of seed varieties   
    + Generating data on food self-sufficiency  
    + Usage of technologies in growing, cooking, eating and/or disposing of food  
    + Food and carbon footprints  
    + Prevalence of Ingredients now and in the past  

+ Food studies and research: blog posts, maps, meta-studies and meta-analysis, data driven infographics, enriched datasets for further research, gazetteers.  

+ Food portal: interface to aggregate, organize & curate informational resources as mashups, dossiers, infographics, taxonomies, databases; making it more meaningful and easier to be accessed for humanitarian, social and public interest topics;  

+ Food classification: use of artificial intelligence techniques for tasks as food classification; identification of ingredients, procedence, extraction of features and cultural analysis. Examples of this kind of propositions are the food and drink related competitions on Kaggle, using some of the references in the section “Datasets”;  

+ Actors:
    + Gastrosophie analysts
    + Community kitchen
    + Scientists
    + Food Activists
    + Foodies

+ Framing a concrete scenario in the OI-RI related to the cultural diversity demonstrator 

### Research questions
+ which ingredients occur most frequently across different recipes/connect different recipes and cultures?  
+ which combination of ingredients is found the most across recipes and does this say anything about their cultural origin?  
+ which ingredients can be identified as “signature ingredients” of a certain culture?  
+ which recipes/diets are most/least sustainably climate-friendly = using little or no meat and dairy products?  
+ which ingredients used in specific recipes are typically grown locally in a certain country/region/culture?  
+ how homogeneous/heterogeneous is the naming of certain ingredients across cultures?  
+ taking scientific findings as a starting point, what is the message your food movement wants to convey to citizens? what should they get active about or participate in? what do you aim to change or provoke with your food movement?   

### Actors experience
+ scientists  
+ citizen activists  
+ NGOs  
+ food companies  
+ agricultural companies  

### Navigation paths
+ by ingredient  
+ by culture  
+ by country  

### Outline of the results (architecture of the portal etc.)
+ scientific: articles, graphs, visualisations  
+ social media: links/examples of food and biodiversity activists & media stars, e.g. Greta Thunberg  
+ NGO: link to reports, documents of food/policy/environment related documents, e.g. UN, etc  
+ Citizen engagement: offer contact point for interested citizens to participate/engage in/join movement
